# Enterprise Architecture 5-Year Vision (2026-2030)

## Vision Statement

**By 2030, Enterprise Architecture will be the utility's trusted strategic partner—proactively shaping technology and business investments, accelerating safe and reliable delivery, and enabling data-driven decisions that drive customer value and operational excellence.**

We will evolve from architecture enablers to business enablers, partnering deeply with business units to transform ideas into executable strategies. Our demand management capabilities will provide enterprise-wide visibility into investments and capacity, ensuring every dollar and resource aligns with our strategic pillars. Through exceptional business acumen and consultative excellence, we will be sought out early and often, helping the utility navigate grid modernization, regulatory change, and customer transformation with confidence and agility.

## How This Vision Aligns to Enterprise Pillars

### People & Culture
**EA's Role:** Build a high-performing, business-savvy team that serves as trusted advisors across the enterprise

**By 2030, we will:**
- Develop a team fluent in utility operations, regulatory drivers, and financial planning—not just technology
- Foster a culture of proactive engagement where architects are embedded partners in business strategy
- Create career pathways that value both technical depth and business partnership skills
- Be known as collaborative problem-solvers who accelerate decisions rather than create bottlenecks
- Cultivate mentorship relationships that develop architecture thinking across the enterprise

**Impact:** Our team will be sought out for their ability to translate complex business challenges into actionable strategies, and our collaborative approach will break down silos between IT, operations, engineering, and business units.

### Operational Excellence
**EA's Role:** Elevate enterprise performance through intelligent architecture that enables safe, reliable, cost-effective operations

**By 2030, we will:**
- Provide architecture guardrails that accelerate project delivery while reducing risk and rework
- Drive technology standardization and rationalization that reduces operational complexity and cost
- Enable proactive identification of technical debt and capacity constraints before they impact reliability
- Support operational decision-making with architecture insights on system dependencies, integration points, and risk
- Measure our impact through avoided costs, accelerated project timelines, and reduced operational incidents

**Impact:** Business and IT leaders will quantify EA's contribution to capital efficiency, operational resilience, and regulatory compliance. Projects architected with EA involvement will demonstrate measurably better outcomes in time, cost, and quality.

### Transformation
**EA's Role:** Be the connective tissue between business strategy and technology execution, enabling transformation with confidence

**By 2030, we will:**
- Operate an intuitive demand management capability that provides real-time visibility into enterprise capacity, portfolio health, and strategic alignment
- Partner with business units from ideation through business case development, ensuring transformation ideas are technically feasible and strategically sound
- Maintain a living enterprise architecture that informs technology roadmaps, investment priorities, and capability assessments
- Enable data-driven transformation by architecting integrated data capabilities that break down information silos
- Accelerate innovation by providing reusable patterns, platforms, and reference architectures

**Impact:** The utility will execute transformations faster and with higher success rates. Business leaders will have confidence that technology investments align with strategy, avoid redundancy, and build enterprise capabilities—not point solutions.

### Growth
**EA's Role:** Enable sustainable, profitable growth by ensuring technology and architecture decisions create long-term enterprise value

**By 2030, we will:**
- Influence investment decisions through architecture-informed business cases that quantify value, risk, and strategic fit
- Help business units identify growth opportunities enabled by technology capabilities (e.g., DER integration, electrification services, customer platforms)
- Provide portfolio-level insights that optimize capital allocation across competing priorities
- Partner with finance and business planning to translate growth strategies into capability roadmaps and investment plans
- Demonstrate EA's ROI through metrics tied to portfolio performance, avoided costs, and strategic value delivery

**Impact:** The utility will achieve better returns on technology investments. Growth initiatives will be supported by scalable, integrated architecture that enables speed to market and customer value. EA will be a valued voice in strategic planning and capital allocation.
