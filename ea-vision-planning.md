- Expand business acumen and talk in business terms

## Clarifying Questions

### Current State & Context

1. What's your current EA team size, and what's the expected headcount trajectory over the next 1-2 years?

2. How is the EA team currently perceived by business stakeholders? (e.g., compliance gate, helpful advisor, unknown/underutilized)

3. What major strategic initiatives is the utility pursuing? (e.g., grid modernization, DER integration, customer platform modernization, AMI deployment, operational technology convergence)

### Demand Management & Business Partnership

4. Does the utility currently have an enterprise PMO, IT portfolio management function, or capital planning process that EA would integrate with for demand management?

5. What does "demand management value stream" mean in your context - are you trying to get visibility into all IT/OT initiatives, or a broader view of business transformation work?

### Stakeholder Landscape

6. Who are the key executives or business leaders you need to build partnerships with? (e.g., COO, CFO, VP Customer Operations, VP Grid Operations, CIO)

7. Does your utility have formal architecture governance today, or is EA influence primarily informal/consultative?

### Measurement & Accountability

8. How is the EA team currently measured or evaluated? Are there existing KPIs or success metrics?

9. What would constitute a meaningful "win" for the EA team in 2026 that would build credibility?

## Next Steps - Choose Your Approach

**Option A:** Receive a vision statement and OKRs now based on common utility patterns, which you can then refine based on your specific context

**Option B:** Provide answers to the questions above to create highly tailored deliverables

## Notes

- Vision should be aspirational yet achievable
- Vision should show evolution from current state (internal consultancy + architecture enablement) to future state (+ proactive demand management + business partnership + business acumen)
- 2026 OKRs should be specific, measurable, and actionable as the first year moving toward the vision
