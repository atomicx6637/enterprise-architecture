## Risk Mitigation

**Risk: Business units don't engage with demand intake or partnership opportunities**
- Mitigation: Start with "friendly" business units; demonstrate value through pilots; secure executive sponsorship

**Risk: Team lacks time/budget for business acumen development**
- Mitigation: Blend low-cost learning (shadowing, lunch-n-learns) with targeted external training; prioritize this as team development investment

**Risk: Can't quantify EA value convincingly**
- Mitigation: Establish conservative methodology early; focus on most tangible value (avoided costs, schedule acceleration); collect stakeholder testimonials as qualitative evidence

**Risk: Tooling/platform limitations hinder demand management capability**
- Mitigation: Start simple (Excel/PowerBI) before investing in sophisticated tools; focus on insights over perfect data

**Risk: Team capacity stretched across too many priorities**
- Mitigation: Be disciplined about scope; it's better to excel at fewer objectives than underdeliver on many; use 70% target to allow for realism

*These OKRs are ambitious but achievable, designed to move us meaningfully toward our 5-year vision while building credibility and momentum. We will treat these as living goals—tracking progress, learning continuously, and adjusting as we go.*
